# autogreeter
Types and erases greetings in various languages.

I've created this to add it to my portfolio's degign because I think it's important to show that I know JavaScript, not only frameworks. Feel free to use it!

# To Use
- Wrap the desired element in `autogreeter-wrap`.
- Add the class `autogreeter` to desired element.
- [optional] Add the class autogreeter-cursor to the same element and style it.
- [optional] Change the `GREETINGS` variable in `autogreeter.js` to add or remove desired languages.
- [optional] Change the speed settings as required. NOTE: Speed is in miliseconds, lowering the number means faster.
